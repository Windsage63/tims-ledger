# Body Content Guidelines

Best practices for structuring SKILL.md body content, based on the [Agent Skills best practices](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices) and [Anthropic's authoring guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

## Length Constraints

| Metric       | Limit       | Notes                          |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Total lines  | 500         | Hard limit for performance     |
| Total tokens | ~5,000      | Approximate context budget     |
| TOC required | 100+ lines  | Helps agent navigate reference |

## Core Principles

### 1. Add What the Agent Lacks, Omit What It Knows

The agent already knows common programming patterns, language syntax, and general engineering principles. **Only add:**

  - Project-specific context and conventions
  - Non-obvious workflows and edge cases
  - Custom output formats
  - Explicit constraints and gotchas
  - The particular tools or APIs to use

**Ask about each piece of content:** "Would the agent get this wrong without this instruction?" If no, cut it.

### 2. Match Specificity to Fragility

Not every part of a skill needs the same level of prescriptiveness:

**High freedom** (flexible instructions) - when multiple approaches are valid:

```markdown
## Code review process

1. Check all database queries for SQL injection
2. Verify authentication checks on every endpoint
3. Look for race conditions in concurrent code paths
```

**Medium freedom** (preferred pattern with parameters):

```markdown
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Summary | Key findings |
| Details | Supporting data |
```

**Low freedom** (exact commands) - when operations are fragile:

````markdown
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

### 3. Provide Defaults, Not Menus

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

```markdown
# Bad: Too many choices

You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image...

# Good: Default with escape hatch

Use pdfplumber for text extraction. For scanned PDFs requiring OCR,
use pdf2image with pytesseract instead.
```

### 4. Examples Over Explanations

```markdown
# Bad: Verbose explanation (150 tokens)

The output should be formatted as a markdown table with three columns.
The first column should contain the component name...

# Good: Concise example (50 tokens)

| Component | Description | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Auth | User authentication | P0 |
```

### 5. Favor Procedures Over Declarations

Teach the agent **how** to approach a class of problems, not **what** to produce for a specific instance:

```markdown
# Bad: Only useful for this exact task

Join the `orders` table to `customers` on `customer_id`, filter where
`region = 'EMEA'`, and sum the `amount` column.

# Good: Reusable method

1. Read the schema from `references/schema.yaml` to find relevant tables
2. Join tables using the `_id` foreign key convention
3. Apply filters from the user's request as WHERE clauses
4. Aggregate numeric columns and format as a markdown table
```

### 6. No Duplication

Information should exist in exactly one place:

  - Core instructions -> SKILL.md
  - Large examples -> `references/`
  - External schemas -> link to source

## Recommended Structure

### Core Sections (Required)

```markdown
## The Job

Brief numbered workflow (5-7 steps max)

## [Main Content]

Skill-specific instructions and patterns

## Stopping Rules

Explicit "do NOT" constraints

## Checklist

Verification steps before completion
```

### Optional Sections

```markdown
## Quick Reference

Summary table for key constraints

## Gotchas

Non-obvious facts that defy reasonable assumptions

## Output Format

Template for skill output
```

## Named Content Patterns

### Gotchas Section

The highest-value content in many skills. Concrete corrections to mistakes the agent will make without being told:

```markdown
## Gotchas

- The `users` table uses soft deletes. Queries must include
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` or results will include deactivated accounts.
- The user ID is `user_id` in the database, `uid` in the auth service,
  and `accountId` in the billing API. All three refer to the same value.
- The `/health` endpoint returns 200 even if the database is down.
  Use `/ready` to check full service health.
```

Keep gotchas in SKILL.md where the agent reads them before encountering the situation.

### Template Pattern

More reliable than describing format in prose:

````markdown
## Report structure

Use this template, adapting sections as needed:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary

[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings

- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data

## Recommendations

1. Specific actionable recommendation
```
````

### Checklist Pattern

Helps the agent track progress through multi-step workflows:

```markdown
## Form processing workflow

Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run `scripts/analyze_form.py`)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit `fields.json`)
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run `scripts/validate_fields.py`)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run `scripts/fill_form.py`)
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run `scripts/verify_output.py`)
```

### Validation Loop Pattern

Do the work -> validate -> fix -> repeat until passing:

```markdown
## Editing workflow

1. Make your edits
2. Run validation: `python scripts/validate.py output/`
3. If validation fails:
   - Review the error message
   - Fix the issues
   - Run validation again
4. Only proceed when validation passes
```

### Plan-Validate-Execute Pattern

For batch or destructive operations - create intermediate plan, validate, then execute:

```markdown
## PDF form filling

1. Extract form fields: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf` -> `form_fields.json`
2. Create `field_values.json` mapping each field name to its intended value
3. Validate: `python scripts/validate_fields.py form_fields.json field_values.json`
4. If validation fails, revise and re-validate
5. Fill the form: `python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf field_values.json output.pdf`
```

### Conditional Workflow Pattern

Guide through decision points:

```markdown
## Document modification workflow

1. Determine the modification type:
   **Creating new content?** -> Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** -> Follow "Editing workflow" below
```

If workflows become large, push them into separate files and tell the agent which file to read based on the task.

### Stopping Rules Pattern

Always include explicit constraints:

```markdown
## Stopping Rules

STOP IMMEDIATELY if you consider:

- [Action that violates scope]
- [Action that belongs to another skill]
- [Action that requires user approval]

This skill's SOLE responsibility is [primary function].
```

## Content Guidelines

### Avoid Time-Sensitive Information

```markdown
# Bad: Will become wrong

If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.

# Good: Use "old patterns" section

## Current method

Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns

<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>
The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`
</details>
```

### Use Consistent Terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout:

  - Always "API endpoint" (not "URL", "API route", "path")
  - Always "field" (not "box", "element", "control")
  - Always "extract" (not "pull", "get", "retrieve")

### Use Forward Slashes in Paths

Always use forward slashes, even on Windows:

  - Good: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
  - Bad: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

## Development Workflow

### Evaluation-Driven Development

1. **Run tasks without a skill** - document specific failures and missing context
2. **Create evaluations** - build ~20 test scenarios: 10 should-trigger, 10 should-not-trigger
3. **Establish baseline** - measure agent performance without the skill
4. **Write minimal instructions** - address only the gaps that caused failures
5. **Validate portability** - check structure, links, encoding, path separators, and agent-agnostic wording
6. **Iterate** - execute evaluations, compare against baseline, refine

### Iterative Development with Fresh Agents

Work with one agent as the expert author and a fresh agent instance as the consumer:

1. Complete a task without a skill - note what context you provided
2. Identify the reusable pattern
3. Ask the authoring agent to create a skill from that pattern
4. Review for conciseness - "Remove the explanation about X, the agent already knows that"
5. Improve information architecture - organize into reference files
6. Test with the fresh consumer agent on similar tasks
7. Iterate based on the consumer agent's behavior - bring insights back to the authoring pass

### Validation Workflow

Use this workflow so that the skill will work across multiple agents:

1. Confirm the folder path is `.agents/skills/[skill-name]/` and the folder name exactly matches the `name` field.
2. Read the frontmatter as plain YAML and verify it contains only `name` and `description`.
3. Check `name` against the portable pattern: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, max 64 characters, no leading/trailing hyphen, no consecutive hyphens.
4. Count the description characters; keep it under 1024 characters and make the first 250 characters sufficient for discovery.
5. Count SKILL.md lines; keep the body under 500 lines and move bulky content to one-level reference files.
6. Follow every relative link from SKILL.md and verify the file exists, is one level deep, and has a clear "when to read" condition.
7. Search the skill for non-portable assumptions: backslash paths, one agent's plugin names, UI-only metadata, hidden memory, or host-specific approval language.
8. Search for rendering artifacts: mojibake marker strings, replacement characters, and box-drawing tree characters that may render poorly in plain terminals.
9. Run representative prompts against at least one fresh agent context. Record trigger misses, false positives, ignored references, and unclear instructions.

### Evaluation Set Template

Create a small evaluation list before expanding the skill:

```markdown
## Should Trigger

- [prompt] -> expected skill behavior

## Should Not Trigger

- [prompt] -> why another skill or general reasoning should handle it

## Task Completion Checks

- [prompt] -> expected artifact, command, analysis, or user-facing output
```

### Observe How Agents Navigate Skills

Watch for:

  - **Unexpected exploration paths** - structure may not be intuitive
  - **Missed connections** - links may need to be more explicit
  - **Overreliance on certain sections** - content may belong in SKILL.md
  - **Ignored content** - files may be unnecessary or poorly signaled

## What to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                | Why It's Bad                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Explaining basic concepts   | Wastes tokens on what the agent knows            |
| Repeating information       | Inflates size, risks inconsistency               |
| Vague instructions          | "Make it good" vs "Follow this template"         |
| Too many options            | Overwhelms; provide defaults                     |
| Nested conditionals         | Hard to follow, error-prone                      |
| Wall of text                | No structure, hard to navigate                   |
| Windows-style paths         | Breaks on Unix; use forward slashes              |
| Time-sensitive references   | Will become wrong; use "old patterns" sections   |
| Magic numbers               | Undocumented constants confuse the agent         |
